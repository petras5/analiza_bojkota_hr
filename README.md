# ðŸ“Š Supermarket Boycott in Croatia â€“ Does One Friday Make a Difference?

This Tableau visualization explores the impact of a supermarket boycott in Croatia in January 2024. Using official data from the Croatian Tax Administration, the goal was to analyze how much of a difference the boycott on Friday, January 26 made â€” by comparing it with the previous week.

## ðŸ“ˆ About the Project

By comparing two full weeks (January 13â€“19 and January 20â€“26), the data revealed:

- ðŸ“‰ **1.543 million fewer receipts** (-5.72%)
- ðŸ’¶ **â‚¬42 million less spending** (-9.31%)

Focusing on the key days around the boycott (Thursday to Saturday), the decline was even more pronounced:

- ðŸ“‰ **11.06% fewer receipts**
- ðŸ’¶ **15.24% drop in spending**

These results suggest that consumers did not shift their purchases to the days before or after the boycott â€” the drop in activity was real and focused.
